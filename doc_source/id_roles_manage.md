# Managing IAM Roles<a name="id_roles_manage"></a>

Occasionally you need to modify or delete the roles that you have created\. To change a role you can modify the policies associated with the role, change who can access the role, and edit the permissions that the role grants to users\. You can also delete roles that are no longer needed\. You can manage your roles from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, and the API\.

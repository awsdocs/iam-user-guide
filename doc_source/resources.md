## Credentials \(Passwords, Access Keys, and MFA devices\)<a name="resources-credentials"></a>

Review the following guides to manage passwords for your AWS account and for IAM users\. You'll also find information about *access keys*—the secret key that you use to make programmatic calls to AWS\.

+  **[Using Multi\-Factor Authentication \(MFA\) in AWS](id_credentials_mfa.md)** – Describes how to configure your account and IAM users to require both a password and a one\-time use code that is generated on a device before sign\-in is allowed\. \(This is sometimes called two\-factor authentication\.\)

## Permissions and Policies<a name="resources-permissions-and-policies"></a>

Learn the inner workings of IAM policies and find tips on the best ways to confer permissions:
+ **[IAM Policies](access_policies.md)** – Describes how permissions can be attached to users or groups or, for some AWS products, to resources themselves\.
+ **[IAM Policies](access_policies.md)** – Introduces the policy language that is used to define permissions\.

## Federation and Delegation<a name="resources-federation-and-delegation"></a>

You can grant access to resources in your AWS account for users who are authenticated \(signed in\) elsewhere\. These can be IAM users in another AWS account \(known as *delegation*\), users who are authenticated with your organization's sign\-in process, or users from an Internet identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) compatible identity provider\. In these cases, the users get temporary security credentials to access AWS resources\. 
+  **[Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles](tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.md)** – Guides you through granting cross\-account access to an IAM user in another AWS account\. 
+ **[Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials](id_credentials_temp.md#sts-introduction)** – Describes ways in which users can be federated into AWS after being authenticated outside of AWS\. 
+ **[Web Identity Federation Playground](https://web-identity-federation-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)** – Lets you experiment with Login with Amazon, Google, or Facebook to authenticate and then make a call to Amazon S3\.

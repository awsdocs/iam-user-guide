# Deleting an IAM Group<a name="id_groups_manage_delete"></a>

When you delete a group in the AWS Management Console, the console automatically removes all group members, detaches all attached managed policies, and deletes all inline policies\. 

In contrast, when you use the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API to delete a group, you must first remove the users in the group, delete any inline policies embedded in the group, and detach any managed policies attached to the group before you can delete the group\. 

**To delete an IAM group \(AWS Management Console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Groups**\. 

1. In the list of groups, select the check box next to the name of the group to delete\. You can use the **Filter** menu and the search box to filter the list of policies\. 

1. Click **Group Actions**, then click **Delete Group**\.

1. In the confirmation box, click **Yes, Delete**\.

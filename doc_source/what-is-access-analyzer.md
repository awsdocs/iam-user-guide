# What Is AWS IAM Access Analyzer?<a name="what-is-access-analyzer"></a>

AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity\. This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a security risk\. Access Analyzer identifies resources that are shared with external principals by using logic\-based reasoning to analyze the resource\-based policies in your AWS environment\. For each instance of a resource that is shared outside of your account, Access Analyzer generates a finding\. Findings include information about the access and the external principal that it is granted to\. You can review findings to determine whether the access is intended and safe, or the access is unintended and a security risk\.

**Note**  
An external entity can be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an AWS service, an anonymous user, or other entity that you can use to create a filter\. For more information, see [AWS JSON Policy Elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)\.

When you enable Access Analyzer, you create an analyzer for your entire organization or your account\. The organization or account you choose is known as the zone of trust for the analyzer\. The analyzer monitors all of the [supported resources](access-analyzer-resources.md) within your zone of trust\. Any access to resources by principals that are within your zone of trust is considered trusted\. Once enabled, Access Analyzer analyzes the policies applied to all of the supported resources in your zone of trust\. After the first analysis, Access Analyzer analyzes these policies periodically\. If a new policy is added, or an existing policy is changed, Access Analyzer analyzes the new or updated policy within about 30 minutes\.

When analyzing the policies, if Access Analyzer identifies one that grants access to an external principal that isn't within your zone of trust, it generates a finding\. Each finding includes details about the resource, the external entity that has access to it, and the permissions granted so that you can take appropriate action\. You can view the details included in the finding to determine whether the resource access is intentional or a potential risk that you should resolve\. When you add a policy to a resource, or update an existing policy, Access Analyzer analyzes the policy\. Access Analyzer also analyzes all resource\-based policies periodically\.

On rare occasions under certain conditions, Access Analyzer is not notified that a policy was added or updated\. For example, a change to account\-level block public access settings on an S3 bucket can take up to 12 hours\. Also, if there is a delivery issue with AWS CloudTrail log delivery the policy change does not trigger a rescan of the resource that was reported in the finding\. When this happens, Access Analyzer analyzes the new or updated policy during the next periodic scan, which is within 24 hours\. If you want to confirm that a change you make to a policy resolves an access issue reported in a finding, you can rescan the resource reported in a finding by using the **Rescan** link in the Finding details page, or by using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_StartResourceScan.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_StartResourceScan.html) operation of the Access Analyzer API\. To learn more, see [Resolving Findings](access-analyzer-findings-remediate.md)\.

**Important**  
Access Analyzer analyzes only policies that are applied to resources in the same AWS Region that it's enabled in\. To monitor all resources in your AWS environment, you must create an analyzer to enable Access Analyzer in each Region where you're using supported AWS resources\.

Access Analyzer analyzes the following resource types:
+ [Amazon Simple Storage Service Buckets](access-analyzer-resources.md#access-analyzer-s3)
+ [AWS Identity and Access Management Roles](access-analyzer-resources.md#access-analyzer-iam-role)
+ [AWS Key Management Service Keys](access-analyzer-resources.md#access-analyzer-kms-key)
+ [AWS Lambda Functions and Layers](access-analyzer-resources.md#access-analyzer-lambda)
+ [Amazon Simple Queue Service Queues](access-analyzer-resources.md#access-analyzer-sqs)

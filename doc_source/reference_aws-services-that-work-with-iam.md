# AWS services that work with IAM<a name="reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam"></a>

The AWS services listed below are grouped by their [AWS product categories](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) and include information about what IAM features they support:
+ **Service** – You can choose the name of a service to view the AWS documentation about IAM authorization and access for that service\.
+ **Actions** – You can specify individual actions in a policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All actions** is selected in the [visual editor](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Action` element\. For a list of actions in each service, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html)\.
+ **Resource\-level permissions** – You can use [ARNs](reference_identifiers.md#identifiers-arns) to specify individual resources in the policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All resources** is chosen in the [policy visual editor](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Resource` element\. Some actions, such as `List*` actions, do not support specifying an ARN because they are designed to return multiple resources\. If a service supports this feature for some resources but not others, it is indicated by **Partial** in the table\. See the documentation for that service for more information\.
+ **Resource\-based policies** – You can attach resource\-based policies to a resource within the service\. Resource\-based policies include a `Principal` element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource\. For more information, see [Identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies](access_policies_identity-vs-resource.md)\.
+ **Authorization based on tags** – You can use [resource tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in the condition of a policy to control access to a resource in the service\. You do this using the [`aws:ResourceTag`](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resourcetag) global condition key or service\-specific tags, such as [`iam:ResourceTag`](reference_policies_examples_iam-add-tag.md)\. For more information about defining permissions based on attributes such as tags, see [What is ABAC for AWS?](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md)\.
+ **Temporary credentials** – You can use short\-term credentials that you obtain when you sign in using SSO, switch roles in the console, or that you generate using AWS STS in the AWS CLI or AWS API\. You can access services with a **No** value only while using your long\-term IAM user credentials\. This includes a user name and password or your user access keys\. For more information, see [Temporary security credentials in IAM](id_credentials_temp.md)\. 
+ **Service\-linked roles** – A [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role) is a special type of service role that gives the service permission to access resources in other services on your behalf\. Choose the `Yes` link to see the documentation for services that support these roles\. This column does not indicate if the service uses standard service roles\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.
+ **More information** – If a service doesn't fully support a feature, you can review the footnotes for an entry to view the limitations and links to related information\.

¹ Amazon EC2 service\-linked roles can be used only for the following features: [Spot Instance Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests), [Spot Fleet Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-fleet-requests), [Amazon EC2 Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/manage-ec2-fleet.html#ec2-fleet-service-linked-role), and [Fast launching for Windows instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/windows-ami-version-history.html#win-ami-config-fast-launch)\.

² AWS Lambda doesn't have service\-linked roles, but Lambda@Edge does\.

¹ IAM supports only one type of resource\-based policy called a role *trust policy*, which is attached to an IAM role\. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to switch roles](id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.md)\.

² IAM supports tag\-based access control for most IAM resources\. For more information, see [Tagging IAM resources](id_tags.md)\.

³ Only some of the API actions for IAM can be called with temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Comparing your API options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)\.

⁴ AWS STS does not have "resources," but does allow restricting access in a similar way to users\. For more information, see [Denying Access to Temporary Security Credentials by Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_disable-perms.html#denying-access-to-credentials-by-name)\.

⁵ Only some of the API operations for AWS STS support calling with temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Comparing your API options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)\.

¹ In an IAM user policy, you cannot restrict permissions to a specific Amazon VPC endpoint\. Any `Action` element that includes the `ec2:*VpcEndpoint*` or `ec2:DescribePrefixLists` API actions must specify "`"Resource": "*"`"\. For more information, see [Controlling the Use of Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoints-iam-access) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 

² Amazon VPC supports attaching a single resource policy to a VPC endpoint to restrict what can be accessed through that endpoint\. For more information about using resource\-based policies to control access to resources from specific Amazon VPC endpoints, see [Using Endpoint Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoint-policies) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

³ Amazon CloudFront doesn't have service\-linked roles, but Lambda@Edge does\. For more information, see [Service\-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-permissions.html#using-service-linked-roles) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide\.

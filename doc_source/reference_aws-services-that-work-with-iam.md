# AWS Services That Work with IAM<a name="reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam"></a>

The AWS services listed below are grouped by their [AWS product categories](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) and include information about what IAM features they support:
+ **Service** – You can choose the name of a service to view the AWS documentation about IAM authorization and access for that service\.
+ **Actions** – You can specify individual actions in a policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All actions** is selected in the [visual editor](access_policies_create.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Action` element\. For a list of actions in each service, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md)\.
+ **Resource\-level permissions** – You can use [ARNs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) to specify individual resources in the policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All resources** is chosen in the [policy visual editor](access_policies_create.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Resource` element\. Some actions, such as `List*` actions, do not support specifying an ARN because they are designed to return multiple resources\. If a service supports this feature for some resources but not others, it is indicated by yellow cells in the table\. See the documentation for that service for more information\.
+ **Resource\-based policies** – You can attach resource\-based policies to a resource within the service\. Resource\-based policies include a `Principal` element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource\. For more information, see [Identity\-Based Policies and Resource\-Based Policies](access_policies_identity-vs-resource.md)\.
+ **Authorization based on tags** – You can use [resource tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in the condition of a policy\. For example, you might create a [ policy that allows tag owners full access to Amazon RDS resources](reference_policies_examples_rds_tag-owner.md) that they have tagged\. You do this by using a condition key such as `rds:db-tag/Owner`\.
+ **Temporary credentials** – Users signed in with federation, a cross\-account role, or a [service role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-role) can access the service\. Temporary security credentials are obtained by calling AWS STS API operations like [AssumeRole](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) or [GetFederationToken](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html)\. For more information, see [Temporary Security Credentials](id_credentials_temp.md)\. 
+ **Service\-linked roles** – A [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role) gives the service permission to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf\. Choose the `Yes` link to see the documentation for services that support these roles\. For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.
+ **More information** – If a service doesn't fully support a feature, you can review the footnotes for an entry to view the limitations and links to related information\.

# Logging IAM Events with AWS CloudTrail<a name="cloudtrail-integration"></a>

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS events made by or on behalf of your AWS account\. CloudTrail logs authenticated AWS API calls and also AWS sign\-in events, and collects this event information in files that are delivered to Amazon S3 buckets\. Using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made to AWS services, who made the request, when it was made, and so on\. 

To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.

## Types of IAM Information Logged in CloudTrail<a name="cloudtrail-integration-iam-information"></a>

 IAM information is available to CloudTrail in these ways: 
+ **API requests to IAM and AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\)** – CloudTrail logs all authenticated API requests \(made with credentials\) to IAM and AWS STS APIs, with the exception of `DecodeAuthorizationMessage`\. CloudTrail also logs nonauthenticated requests to the AWS STS actions, `AssumeRoleWithSAML` and `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` and logs information provided by the identity provider\. You can use this information to map calls made by a federated user with an assumed role back to the originating external federated caller\. In the case of `AssumeRole`, you can map calls back to the originating AWS service or to the account of the originating user\. The `userIdentity` section of the JSON data in the CloudTrail log entry contains the information that you need to map the AssumeRole\* request with a specific federated user\. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity Element](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\.

  For example, calls to the IAM `CreateUser`, `DeleteRole`, `ListGroups`, and other API operations are all logged by CloudTrail\. 

  Examples for this type of log entry are presented later in this topic\. 
**Important**  
If you activate AWS STS endpoints in regions other than the default global endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those regions to record any AWS STS API calls made in those regions\. For more information, see [Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html) in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide\.
+ **API requests to other AWS services** – Authenticated requests to other AWS service APIs are logged by CloudTrail, and these log entries contain information about who generated the request\. 

  For example, if a request is made to list Amazon EC2 instances or create an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, the user identity of the person or service that made the request is contained in the log entry for that request\. The user identity information helps you determine whether the request was made with AWS account root user credentials or IAM user credentials, with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user, or by another AWS service\. 

  For more details about the user identity information in CloudTrail log entries, see [userIdentity Element](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/event_reference_user_identity.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\. 
+ **AWS sign\-in events** – Sign\-in events to the AWS Management Console, the AWS Discussion Forums, and the AWS Marketplace are logged by CloudTrail\. 

  For example, IAM and federated user sign\-in events—successful sign\-ins and failed sign\-in attempts—are logged by CloudTrail\. Additionally, successful sign\-in events by the root user are logged by CloudTrail\. Note that unsuccessful sign\-in events by the root user are *not *logged by CloudTrail\.

  If you enable CloudTrail to log sign\-in events to your logs, you need to be aware of how CloudTrail chooses where to log the events\.
  + If your users sign in directly to a console, they are redirected to either a global or a regional sign\-in endpoint, based on whether the selected service console supports regions\. For example, the main console home page supports regions, so if you sign in to the following URL:

    ```
    https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
    ```

    you are redirected to a regional sign\-in endpoint such as `https://us-east-2.signin.aws.amazon.com`, resulting in a regional CloudTrail log entry in the user's region's log:

    On the other hand, the Amazon S3 console does not support regions, so if you sign in to the following URL

    ```
    https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/s3
    ```

    AWS redirects you to the global sign\-in endpoint at `https://signin.aws.amazon.com`, resulting in a global CloudTrail log entry\.
  + You can manually request a certain regional sign\-in endpoint by signing in to the region\-enabled main console home page using a URL syntax like the following:

    ```
    https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=ap-southeast-1
    ```

    AWS redirects you to the `ap-southeast-1` regional sign\-in endpoint and results in a regional CloudTrail log event\.
**Important**  
As a security best practice, AWS does not log the entered user name text when the sign\-in failure is caused by *an incorrect user name*\. The user name text is masked by the value `HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS`\. For an example of this, see [Sign\-in Failure Event Caused by Incorrect User Name](#hiddensecurity), later in this topic\. The reason the user name is obscured is because such failures might be caused by user errors like the following, which, if logged, could expose potentially sensitive information:  
You accidentally type your password in the user name field\.
You click the link for one AWS account's sign\-in page, but then type the account number for a different one\.
You forget which account you are signing in to and accidentally type the account name of your personal email account, your bank sign\-in identifier, or some other private ID\. 

  Whether the sign\-in event is considered to a regional event or a global one depends on the console the user is signing into, and how the user constructs the sign\-in URL\.
  + Is the service console regionalized? If so, then the sign\-in request is automatically redirected to a regional sign\-in endpoint and the event is logged in that region's CloudTrail log\. For example, if you sign in to `https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console` the console home page which is regionalized, you are automatically redirected you to a sign\-in endpoint in your region \(for example, `https://us-east-2.signin.aws.amazon.com`\), and the event is logged in that region's log\.

    However, some services are not regionalized yet\. For example, the Amazon S3 service is *not* currently regionalized, so if you sign in to `https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/s3`, you are redirected to the global sign\-in endpoint at `https://signin.aws.amazon.com`, resulting in an event in your global log\.
  + You can also manually request a certain regional sign\-in endpoint by using a URL syntax like `https://alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=ap-southeast-1`, which redirects to the ap\-southeast\-1 regional sign\-in endpoint and results in an event in the regional log\.
+ **How temporary credential requests are logged** – When a principal requests temporary credentials, the principal type determines how CloudTrail logs the event\. The following table shows how CloudTrail logs different information for each of the API calls that generate temporary credentials\.

## Examples of Logged Events in CloudTrail Files<a name="cloudtrail-integration-understanding-records"></a>

CloudTrail log files contain events that are formatted using JSON\. An event represents a single API request or sign\-in event and includes information about the requested action, any parameters, and the date and time of the action\. 

### IAM API Event in CloudTrail Log File<a name="w3ab1c19c30c11b4"></a>

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for a request made for the IAM `GetUserPolicy` action\. 

```
{
  "eventVersion": "1.05",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
    "arn": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:user/Alice",
    "accountId": "444455556666",
    "accessKeyId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
    "userName": "Alice",
    "sessionContext": {
      "attributes": {
        "mfaAuthenticated": "false",
        "creationDate": "2014-07-15T21:39:40Z"
      }
    },
    "invokedBy": "signin.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "eventTime": "2014-07-15T21:40:14Z",
  "eventSource": "iam.amazonaws.com",
  "eventName": "GetUserPolicy",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
  "sourceIPAddress": "signin.amazonaws.com",
  "userAgent": "signin.amazonaws.com",
  "requestParameters": {
    "userName": "Alice",
    "policyName": "ReadOnlyAccess-Alice-201407151307"
  },
  "responseElements": null,
  "requestID": "9EXAMPLE-0c68-11e4-a24e-d5e16EXAMPLE",
  "eventID": "cEXAMPLE-127e-4632-980d-505a4EXAMPLE"
}
```

From this event information, you can determine that the request was made to get a user policy named `ReadOnlyAccess-Alice-201407151307` for user `Alice`, as specified in the `requestParameters` element\. You can also see that the request was made by an IAM user named `Alice` on July 15, 2014 at 9:40 PM \(UTC\)\. In this case, the request originated in the AWS Management Console, as you can tell from the `userAgent` element\. 

### AWS STS API Event in CloudTrail Log File<a name="stscloudtrailexample"></a>

The IAM user named "Bob" in account 777788889999 calls the AWS STS `AssumeRole` action to assume the role `EC2-dev` in account 111122223333\. The next two examples show the CloudTrail log entries for the two affected accounts\. The first example shows the CloudTrail log entry for the request made in account 777788889999, the account that owns the user who calls `AssumeRole`\.

```

      "accessKeyId": "AKIAQRSTUVWXYZEXAMPLE",
      "expiration": "Jul 18, 2014 4:07:39 PM"
      },
    "assumedRoleUser": {
      "assumedRoleId": "AIDAQRSTUVWXYZEXAMPLE:Bob-EC2-dev",
      "arn": "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/EC2-dev/Bob-EC2-dev"
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "ARN": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/EC2-dev",
      "accountId": "111122223333",
      "type": "AWS::IAM::Role"
    }
  ],
  "requestID": "4EXAMPLE-0e8d-11e4-96e4-e55c0EXAMPLE",
  "sharedEventID": "bEXAMPLE-efea-4a70-b951-19a88EXAMPLE",
  "eventID": "dEXAMPLE-ac7f-466c-a608-4ac8dEXAMPLE"
  "eventType": "AwsApiCall",   
  "recipientAccountId": "111122223333"
}
```

The second example shows the role owning account's \(111122223333\) CloudTrail log entry for the same request\.

### Sign\-in Failure Event in CloudTrail Log File<a name="w3ab1c19c30c11b8"></a>

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for a failed sign\-in event\.

```
{
  "eventVersion": "1.05",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
    "arn":"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Alice",
    "accountId": "111122223333",
    "userName": "Alice"
  },
  "eventTime": "2014-07-08T17:35:27Z",
  "eventSource": "signin.amazonaws.com",
  "eventName": "ConsoleLogin",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
  "sourceIPAddress": "192.0.2.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0",
  "errorMessage": "Failed authentication",
  "requestParameters": null,
  "responseElements": {
    "ConsoleLogin": "Failure"
  },
  "additionalEventData": {

    "MFAUsed": "No"
  },
  "eventID": "11ea990b-4678-4bcd-8fbe-62509088b7cf"
}
```

From this information, you can determine that the sign\-in attempt was made by an IAM user named Alice, as shown in the `userIdentity` element\. You can also see that the sign\-in attempt failed, as shown in the `responseElements` element\. You can see that Alice tried to sign in to the Amazon SNS console at 5:35 PM \(UTC\) on July 8th, 2014\.

### Sign\-in Failure Event Caused by Incorrect User Name<a name="hiddensecurity"></a>

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for an unsuccessful sign\-in event caused by the user entering an incorrect user name\. AWS masks the `userName` text with `HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS` to help prevent exposing potentially sensitive information\.

## Preventing Duplicate Log Entries in CloudTrail<a name="cloudtrail-integration-global-service"></a>

CloudTrail creates trails in each region separately\. These trails include information for events that occur in those regions, plus global \(that is, non\-region\-specific\) events such as IAM API calls, non\-region specific AWS STS calls \(calls to `sts.amazonaws.com`\), and AWS sign\-in events\. For example, by default, if you have two trails, each in a different region, and you then create a new IAM user, the `CreateUser` event is added to the log files in both regions, creating a duplicate log entry\. 

**Note**  
By default, AWS Security Token Service \(STS\) is a global service with a single endpoint at https://sts\.amazonaws\.com\. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls to a global service\. However, because this endpoint is physically located in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) region, your logs list "us\-east\-1" as the event region\. CloudTrail does not write these logs to the US East \(Ohio\) region unless you choose to include global service logs in that region\. CloudTrail writes calls to all regional endpoints to their respective regions\. For example, calls to `sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` are published to the US East \(Ohio\) region, calls to `sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` are published to the EU \(Frankfurt\) region, etc\.   
For more information about multiple regions and AWS STS see [Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region](id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.md)\. 

The following table lists the regions and how CloudTrail logs AWS STS requests in each region\. The "Location" column indicates which logs CloudTrail writes to\. "Global" means the event is logged in any region for which you choose to include global service logs in that region\. "Region" means that the event is logged only in the region where the endpoint is located\. The last column indicates how the request's region is identified in the log entry\.

When you configure CloudTrail to aggregate trail information from multiple regions in your account into a single Amazon S3 bucket, IAM events are duplicated in the logs—the trail for each region writes the same IAM event to the aggregated log\. To prevent this duplication, you can include global events selectively\. A typical approach is to enable global events in one trail and to disable global events in all other trails that write to the same Amazon S3 bucket\. That way only one set of global events is written\.

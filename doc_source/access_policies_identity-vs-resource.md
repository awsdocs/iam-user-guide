# Identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies<a name="access_policies_identity-vs-resource"></a>

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions\. When you create a permissions policy to restrict access to a resource, you can choose an *identity\-based policy* or a *resource\-based policy*\.

**Identity\-based policies** are attached to an IAM user, group, or role\. These policies let you specify what that identity can do \(its permissions\)\. For example, you can attach the policy to the IAM user named John, stating that he is allowed to perform the Amazon EC2 `RunInstances` action\. The policy could further state that John is allowed to get items from an Amazon DynamoDB table named `MyCompany`\. You can also allow John to manage his own IAM security credentials\. Identity\-based policies can be [managed or inline](access_policies_managed-vs-inline.md)\.

**Resource\-based policies** are attached to a resource\. For example, you can attach resource\-based policies to Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SQS queues, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys\. For a list of services that support resource\-based policies, see [AWS services that work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md)\.

With resource\-based policies, you can specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform on it\. To learn whether principals in accounts outside of your zone of trust \(trusted organization or account\) have access to assume your roles, see [What is IAM Access Analyzer?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)\. Resource\-based policies are inline only, not managed\.

**Note**  
*Resource\-based* policies differ from *resource\-level* permissions\. You can attach resource\-based policies directly to a resource, as described in this topic\. Resource\-level permissions refer to the ability to use [ARNs](reference_identifiers.md#identifiers-arns) to specify individual resources in a policy\. Resource\-based policies are supported only by some AWS services\. For a list of which services support resource\-based policies and resource\-level permissions, see [AWS services that work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md)\.

To better understand these concepts, view the following figure\. The administrator of the `123456789012` account attached *identity\-based policies* to the `JohnSmith`, `CarlosSalazar`, and `MaryMajor` users\. Some of the actions in these policies can be performed on specific resources\. For example, the user `JohnSmith` can perform some actions on `Resource X`\. This is a *resource\-level permission* in an identity\-based policy\. The administrator also added *resource\-based policies* to `Resource X`, `Resource Y`, and `Resource Z`\. Resource\-based policies allow you to specify who can access that resource\. For example, the resource\-based policy on `Resource X` allows the `JohnSmith` and `MaryMajor` users list and read access to the resource\.

The `123456789012` account example allows the following users to perform the listed actions:
+ **JohnSmith** – John can perform list and read actions on `Resource X`\. He is granted this permission by the identity\-based policy on his user and the resource\-based policy on `Resource X`\.
+ **CarlosSalazar** – Carlos can perform list, read, and write actions on `Resource Y`, but is denied access to `Resource Z`\. The identity\-based policy on Carlos allows him to perform list and read actions on `Resource Y`\. The `Resource Y` resource\-based policy also allows him write permissions\. However, although his identity\-based policy allows him access to `Resource Z`, the `Resource Z` resource\-based policy denies that access\. An explicit `Deny` overrides an `Allow` and his access to `Resource Z` is denied\. For more information, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md)\. 
+ **MaryMajor** – Mary can perform list, read, and write operations on `Resource X`, `Resource Y`, and `Resource Z`\. Her identity\-based policy allows her more actions on more resources than the resource\-based policies, but none of them deny access\.
+ **ZhangWei** – Zhang has full access to `Resource Z`\. Zhang has no identity\-based policies, but the `Resource Z` resource\-based policy allows him full access to the resource\. Zhang can also perform list and read actions on `Resource Y`\.

Identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies are both permissions policies and are evaluated together\. For a request to which only permissions policies apply, AWS first checks all policies for a `Deny`\. If one exists, then the request is denied\. Then AWS checks for each `Allow`\. If at least one policy statement allows the action in the request, the request is allowed\. It doesn't matter whether the `Allow` is in the identity\-based policy or the resource\-based policy\.

**Important**  
This logic applies only when the request is made within a single AWS account\. For requests made from one account to another, the requester in `Account A` must have an identity\-based policy that allows them to make a request to the resource in `Account B`\. Also, the resource\-based policy in `Account B` must allow the requester in `Account A` to access the resource\. There must be policies in both accounts that allow the operation, otherwise the request fails\. For more information about using resource\-based policies for cross\-account access, see [How IAM roles differ from resource\-based policies](id_roles_compare-resource-policies.md)\.

A user who has specific permissions might request a resource that also has a permissions policy attached to it\. In that case, AWS evaluates both sets of permissions when determining whether to grant access to the resource\. For information about how policies are evaluated, see [Policy evaluation logic](reference_policies_evaluation-logic.md)\. 

**Note**  
Amazon S3 supports identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies \(referred to as *bucket policies*\)\. In addition, Amazon S3 supports a permission mechanism known as an *access control list \(ACL\)* that is independent of IAM policies and permissions\. You can use IAM policies in combination with Amazon S3 ACLs\. For more information, see [Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAuthAccess.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

# Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console \(Custom Federation Broker\)<a name="id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url"></a>

You can write and run code to create a URL that lets users who sign in to your organization's network securely access the AWS Management Console\. The URL includes a sign\-in token that you get from AWS and that authenticates the user to AWS\.

**Note**  
If your organization uses an identity provider \(IdP\) that is compatible with SAML, you can set up access to the console without writing code\. This works with providers like Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Services or open\-source Shibboleth\. For details, see [Enabling SAML 2\.0 Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console](id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.md)\. 

To enable your organization's users to access the AWS Management Console, you can create a custom *identity broker* that performs the following steps:

1. Verify that the user is authenticated by your local identity system\.

1. Call the AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) \(recommended\) or [GetFederationToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html) API operations to obtain temporary security credentials for the user\. To learn about the different methods that you can use to assume a role, see [Using IAM Roles](id_roles_use.md)\.
   + If you use one of the `AssumeRole*` API operations to get the temporary security credentials for a role, you can include the `DurationSeconds` parameter in your call\. This parameter specifies the duration of your role session, from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role\. To learn how to view or change the maximum value for a role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role](id_roles_use.md#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)\. Additionally, if you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations, you must call them as an IAM user with long\-term credentials\. Otherwise, the call to the federation endpoint in step 3 fails\.
   + If you use the `GetFederationToken` API operation to get the credentials, you can include the `DurationSeconds` parameter in your call\. This parameter specifies the duration of your role session\. The value can range from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) to 129,600 seconds \(36 hours\)\. You can make this API call only by using the long\-term AWS security credentials of an IAM user\. You can also make these calls using AWS account root user credentials, but we do not recommended it\. If you make this call as the root user, the default session lasts for one hour\. Or you can specify a session from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) up to 3,600 seconds \(one hour\)\. 

1. Call the AWS federation endpoint and supply the temporary security credentials to request a sign\-in token\.

1. Construct a URL for the console that includes the token:
   + If you use one of the `AssumeRole*` API operations in your URL, you can include the `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter\. This parameter specifies the duration of the console session, from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) to 43200 seconds \(12 hours\)\.
   + If you use the `GetFederationToken` API operation in your URL, you can include the `DurationSeconds` parameter\. This parameter specifies the duration of the federated console session\. The value can range from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) to 129,600 seconds \(36 hours\)\. 
**Note**  
Do not use the `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter if you got the temporary credentials with `GetFederationToken`\. Doing so will cause the operation to fail\.

1. Give the URL to the user or invoke the URL on the user's behalf\.

The URL that the federation endpoint provides is valid for 15 minutes after it is created\. This differs from the duration \(in seconds\) of the temporary security credential session that is associated with the URL\. Those credentials are valid for the duration you specified when you created them, starting from the time they were created\.

**Important**  
The URL grants access to your AWS resources through the AWS Management Console if you have enabled permissions in the associated temporary security credentials\. For this reason, you should treat the URL as a secret\. We recommend returning the URL through a secure redirect, for example, by using a 302 HTTP response status code over an SSL connection\. For more information about the 302 HTTP response status code, go to [RFC 2616, section 10\.3\.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.3)\.

To view a sample application that shows you how you can implement a single sign\-on solution, go to [AWS Management Console federation proxy sample use case](https://aws.amazon.com/code/4001165270590826) in the *AWS Sample Code & Libraries*\.

To complete these tasks, you can use the [HTTPS Query API for AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/) and the [AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/)\. Or, you can use programming languages, such as Java, Ruby, or C\#, along with the appropriate [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\. Each of these methods is described in the following sections\.

## Example Code Using IAM Query API Operations<a name="STSConsoleLink_manual"></a>

You can construct a URL that gives your federated users direct access to the AWS Management Console\. This task uses the IAM and AWS STS HTTPS Query API\. For more information about making query requests, see [Making Query Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide//IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html)\.

**Note**  
The following procedure contains examples of text strings\. To enhance readability, line breaks have been added to some of the longer examples\. When you create these strings for your own use, you should omit any line breaks\.

**To give a federated user access to your resources from the AWS Management Console**

1. Authenticate the user in your identity and authorization system\.

1. Obtain temporary security credentials for the user\. The temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token\. For more information about creating temporary credentials, see [Temporary Security Credentials](id_credentials_temp.md)\.

   To get temporary credentials, you call either the AWS STS [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API \(recommended\) or the [GetFederationToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html) API\. For more information about the differences between these API operations, see [Understanding the API Options for Securely Delegating Access to Your AWS Account](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/understanding-the-api-options-for-securely-delegating-access-to-your-aws-account) in the AWS Security Blog\.
**Important**  
When you use the [GetFederationToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html) API to create temporary security credentials, you must specify the permissions that the credentials grant to the user who assumes the role\. For any of the API operations that begin with `AssumeRole*`, you use an IAM role to assign permissions\. For the other API operations, the mechanism varies with the API\. For more details, see [Controlling Permissions for Temporary Security Credentials](id_credentials_temp_control-access.md)\. Additionally, if you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations, you must call them as an IAM user with long\-term credentials\. Otherwise, the call to the federation endpoint in step 3 fails\.

1. After you obtain the temporary security credentials, build them into a JSON session string to exchange them for a sign\-in token\. The following example shows how to encode the credentials\. You replace the placeholder text with the appropriate values from the credentials that you receive in the previous step\.

   ```
   {"sessionId":"*** temporary access key ID ***",
   "sessionKey":"*** temporary secret access key ***",
   "sessionToken":"*** security token ***"}
   ```

1. [URL encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the session string from the previous step\. Because the information that you are encoding is sensitive, we recommend that you avoid using a web service for this encoding\. Instead, use a locally installed function or feature in your development toolkit to securely encode this information\. You can use the `urllib.quote_plus` function in Python, the `URLEncoder.encode` function in Java, or the `CGI.escape` function in Ruby\. See the examples later in this topic\.

1. <a name="STSConsoleLink_manual_step5"></a>Send your request to the AWS federation endpoint at the following address:

   `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation` 

   The request must include the `Action` and `Session` parameters, and \(optionally\) if you used an [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API operation, a `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   Action = getSigninToken
   SessionDuration = time in seconds
   Session = *** the URL encoded JSON string created in steps 3 & 4 ***
   ```

   The `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter specifies the duration of the console session\. This is separate from the duration of the temporary credentials that you specify using the `DurationSeconds` parameter\. You can specify a `SessionDuration` maximum value of 43,200 \(12 hours\)\. If the `SessionDuration` parameter is missing, then the session defaults to the duration of the credentials that you retrieved from AWS STS in step 2 \(which defaults to one hour\)\. See the [documentation for the `AssumeRole` API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) for details about how to specify a duration using the `DurationSeconds` parameter\. The ability to create a console session that is longer than one hour is intrinsic to the `getSigninToken` operation of the federation endpoint\.
**Note**  
Do not use the `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter if you got the temporary credentials with `GetFederationToken`\. Doing so will cause the operation to fail\.

   When you enable console sessions with an extended duration, the risk of compromise of the credentials rises\. To help you mitigate this risk, you can immediately disable the active console sessions for any role by choosing **Revoke Sessions** on the **Role Summary** IAM console page\. For more information, see [Revoking IAM Role Temporary Security Credentials](id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.md)\. 

    The following is an example of what your request might look like\. The lines are wrapped here for readability, but you should submit it as a one\-line string\.

   ```
   https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation
   ?Action=getSigninToken
   &SessionDuration=1800
   &Session=%7B%22sessionId%22%3A+%22ASIAJUMHIZPTOKTBMK5A%22%2C+%22sessionKey%22
   %3A+%22LSD7LWI%2FL%2FN%2BgYpan5QFz0XUpc8s7HYjRsgcsrsm%22%2C+%22sessionToken%2
   2%3A+%22FQoDYXdzEBQaDLbj3VWv2u50NN%2F3yyLSASwYtWhPnGPMNmzZFfZsL0Qd3vtYHw5A5dW
   AjOsrkdPkghomIe3mJip5%2F0djDBbo7SmO%2FENDEiCdpsQKodTpleKA8xQq0CwFg6a69xdEBQT8
   FipATnLbKoyS4b%2FebhnsTUjZZQWp0wXXqFF7gSm%2FMe2tXe0jzsdP0O12obez9lijPSdF1k2b5
   PfGhiuyAR9aD5%2BubM0pY86fKex1qsytjvyTbZ9nXe6DvxVDcnCOhOGETJ7XFkSFdH0v%2FYR25C
   UAhJ3nXIkIbG7Ucv9cOEpCf%2Fg23ijRgILIBQ%3D%3D%22%7D
   ```

   The response from the federation endpoint is a JSON document with a `SigninToken` value\. It will look similar to the following example\.

   ```
   {"SigninToken":"*** the SigninToken string ***"}
   ```

1. Finally, create the URL that your federated users can use to access the AWS Management Console\. The URL is the same federation URL endpoint that you used in [Step 5](#STSConsoleLink_manual_step5), plus the following parameters:

   ```
   ?Action = login
   &Issuer = *** the form-urlencoded URL for your internal sign-in page ***
   &Destination = *** the form-urlencoded URL to the desired AWS console page ***
   &SigninToken = *** the value of SigninToken received in the previous step ***
   ```

   The following example shows what the final URL might look like\. The URL is valid for 15 minutes from the time it is created\. The temporary security credentials and console session embedded within the URL are valid for the duration you specify in the `SessionDuration` HTTP parameter when you initially request them\. 

   ```
   https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation
   ?Action=login
   &Issuer=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
   &Destination=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fs

## Example Code Using Python<a name="STSConsoleLink_programPython"></a>

The following example shows how to use Python to programmatically construct a URL that gives federated users direct access to the AWS Management Console\. The example uses the [AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\)](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\. 

The code uses the [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API to obtain temporary security credentials\.

```
import urllib, json
import requests # 'pip install requests'
from boto.sts import STSConnection # AWS SDK for Python (Boto) 'pip install boto'

# Step 1: Authenticate user in your own identity system.

# Step 2: Using the access keys for an IAM user in your AWS account,
# call "AssumeRole" to get temporary access keys for the federated user

# Note: Calls to AWS STS AssumeRole must be signed using the access key ID 
# and secret access key of an IAM user or using existing temporary credentials.
# The credentials can be in EC2 instance metadata, in environment variables, 
# or in a configuration file, and will be discovered automatically by the 
# STSConnection() function. For more information, see the Python SDK docs:
# http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
sts_connection = STSConnection()

assumed_role_object = sts_connection.assume_role(
    role_arn="arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:role/ROLE-NAME",
    role_session_name="AssumeRoleSession"
)

# Step 3: Format resulting temporary credentials into JSON
json_string_with_temp_credentials = '{'
json_string_with_temp_credentials += '"sessionId":"' + assumed_role_object.credentials.access_key + '",'
json_string_with_temp_credentials += '"sessionKey":"' + assumed_role_object.credentials.secret_key + '",'
json_string_with_temp_credentials += '"sessionToken":"' + assumed_role_object.credentials.session_token + '"'
json_string_with_temp_credentials += '}'

# Step 4. Make request to AWS federation endpoint to get sign-in token. Construct the parameter string with
# the sign-in action request, a 12-hour session duration, and the JSON document with temporary credentials 
# as parameters.
request_parameters = "?Action=getSigninToken"
request_parameters += "&DurationSeconds=43200"
request_parameters += "&Session=" + urllib.quote_plus(json_string_with_temp_credentials)
request_url = "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation" + request_parameters
r = requests.get(request_url)
# Returns a JSON document with a single element named SigninToken.
signin_token = json.loads(r.text)

# Step 5: Create URL where users can use the sign-in token to sign in to 
# the console. This URL must be used within 15 minutes after the
# sign-in token was issued.
request_parameters = "?Action=login" 
request_parameters += "&Issuer=Example.org" 
request_parameters += "&Destination=" + urllib.quote_plus("https://console.aws.amazon.com/")
request_parameters += "&SigninToken=" + signin_token["SigninToken"]
request_url = "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation" + request_parameters

# Send final URL to stdout
print request_url
```

## Example Code Using Java<a name="STSConsoleLink_programJava"></a>

## Example Showing How to Construct the URL \(Ruby\)<a name="STSConsoleLink_programRuby"></a>

The following example shows how to use Ruby to programmatically construct a URL that gives federated users direct access to the AWS Management Console\. This code snippet uses the [AWS SDK for Ruby](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforruby/)\. 

```
require 'rubygems'

# Roles Terms and Concepts<a name="id_roles_terms-and-concepts"></a>

Here are some basic terms to help you get started with roles\.

**Role**  <a name="iam-term-role"></a>
A set of permissions that grant access to actions and resources in AWS\. These permissions are attached to the role, not to an IAM user or group\. Roles can be used by the following:  
+ An IAM user in the same AWS account as the role
+ An IAM user in a different AWS account as the role
+ A web service offered by AWS such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)
+ An external user authenticated by an external identity provider \(IdP\) service that is compatible with SAML 2\.0 or OpenID Connect, or a custom\-built identity broker\.

   

****AWS service role****  <a name="iam-term-service-role"></a>
A role that a service assumes to perform actions in your account on your behalf\. When you set up most AWS service environments, you must define a role for the service to assume\. This service role must include all the permissions required for the service to access the AWS resources that it needs\. Service roles vary from service to service, but many allow you to choose your permissions, as long as you meet the documented requirements for that service\. Service roles provide access only within your account and cannot be used to grant access to services in other accounts\. You can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM\.

****AWS service role for an EC2 instance****  <a name="iam-term-service-role-ec2"></a>
A special type of service role that a service assumes to launch an Amazon EC2 instance that runs your application\. This role is assigned to the EC2 instance when it is launched\. AWS automatically provides temporary security credentials that are attached to the role and then makes them available for the EC2 instance to use on behalf of its applications\. For details about using a service role for an EC2 instance, see [Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances](id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.md)\.

****AWS service\-linked role****  <a name="iam-term-service-linked-role"></a>
A unique type of service role that is linked directly to an AWS service\. Service\-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. The linked service also defines how you create, modify, and delete a service\-linked role\. A service might automatically create or delete the role\. It might allow you to create, modify, or delete the role as part of a wizard or process in the service\. Or it might require that you use IAM to create or delete the role\. Regardless of the method, service\-linked roles make setting up a service easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions\.  
If you are already using a service when it begins supporting service\-linked roles, you might receive an email telling you about a new role in your account\. In this case, the service automatically created the service\-linked role in your account\. You don't need to take any action to support this role, and you should not manually delete it\. For more information, see [A New Role Appeared in My AWS Account](troubleshoot_roles.md#troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared)\.
For information about which services support using service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md) and look for the services that have **Yes **in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service\-linked role documentation for that service\. If the service does not include documentation for creating, modifying, or deleting the service\-linked role, then you can use the IAM console, CLI, or API\. For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

****Delegation****  <a name="delegation"></a>
The granting of permission to someone to allow access to resources that you control\. Delegation involves setting up a trust between the account that owns the resource \(the trusting account\), and the account that contains the users that need to access the resource \(the trusted account\)\. The trusted and trusting accounts can be any of the following:  
+ The same account\.
+ Two accounts that are both under your \(organization's\) control\.
+ Two accounts owned by different organizations\.
To delegate permission to access a resource, you [create an IAM role](id_roles_create_for-user.md) that has two [policies](#term_policy) attached\. The *permissions policy* grants the user of the role the needed permissions to carry out the intended tasks on the resource\. The *trust policy* specifies which trusted accounts are allowed to grant its users permissions to assume the role\.  
When you create a trust policy, you cannot specify a wildcard \(\*\) as a principal\. The trust policy on the role in the trusting account is one\-half of the permissions\. The other half is a permissions policy attached to the user in the trusted account that [allows that user to switch to, or assume the role](id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.md)\. A user who assumes a role temporarily gives up his or her own permissions and instead takes on the permissions of the role\. When the user exits, or stops using the role, the original user permissions are restored\. An additional parameter called [external ID](id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.md) helps ensure secure use of roles between accounts that are not controlled by the same organization\.

****Federation****  
The creation of a trust relationship between an external identity provider and AWS\. Users can sign in to a web identity provider, such as **Login with Amazon**, **Facebook**, **Google**, or any IdP that is compatible with **OpenID Connect** \(OIDC\)\. Users can also sign in to an enterprise identity system that is compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) 2\.0, such as Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services\. When you use OIDC and SAML 2\.0 to configure a trust relationship between these external identity providers and AWS, the user is assigned to an IAM role and receives temporary credentials that enable the user to access your AWS resources\. 

****Trust policy****  <a name="term_trust-policy"></a>
A document in [JSON](http://www.json.org) format in which you define who is allowed to assume the role\. This trusted entity is included in the policy as the *principal* element in the document\. The document is written according to the rules of the [IAM policy language](reference_policies.md)\.

****Permissions policy****  <a name="term_policy"></a>
A permissions document in [JSON](http://www.json.org) format in which you define what actions and resources the role can use\. The document is written according to the rules of the [IAM policy language](reference_policies.md)\.

****Principal****  
An entity in AWS that can perform actions and access resources\. A principal can be an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or a role\. You can grant permissions to access a resource in one of two ways:  
+ You can attach a permissions policy to a user \(directly, or indirectly through a group\) or to a role\.
+ For those services that support [resource\-based policies](introduction_access-management.md#intro-access-resource-based-policies), you can identify the principal in the `Principal` element of a policy attached to the resource\.
If you reference an AWS account as principal, it generally means any principal defined within that account\.  
You cannot use a wildcard \(\*\) in the `Principal` element in a role's trust policy\.

****Role for cross\-account access****  
Granting access to resources in one account to a trusted principal in a different account\. Roles are the primary way to grant cross\-account access\. However, with some of the web services offered by AWS you can attach a policy directly to a resource \(instead of using a role as a proxy\)\. These are called resource\-based policies, and you can use them to grant principals in another AWS account access to the resource\. The following services support resource\-based policies for the specified resources: Amazon Simple Storage Service \(S3\) buckets, Amazon Glacier vaults, Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\) topics, and Amazon Simple Queue Service \(SQS\) queues\. For more information, see [How IAM Roles Differ from Resource\-based Policies](id_roles_compare-resource-policies.md)\.

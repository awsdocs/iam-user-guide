# Getting set up with IAM<a name="getting-set-up"></a>

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) helps you securely control access to Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) and your account resources\. IAM can also keep your account credentials private\. With IAM, you can create multiple IAM users under the umbrella of your AWS account or enable temporary access through identity federation with your corporate directory\. In some cases, you can also enable access to resources across AWS accounts\.

Without IAM, however, you must either create multiple AWS accounts—each with its own billing and subscriptions to AWS products—or your employees must share the security credentials of a single AWS account\. In addition, without IAM, you cannot control the tasks a particular user or system can do and what AWS resources they might use\. 

This guide provides a conceptual overview of IAM, describes business use cases, and explains AWS permissions and policies\.

## Using IAM to give users access to your AWS resources<a name="UsingIAMToGiveAccess"></a>

Here are the ways you can use IAM to control access to your AWS resources\.

## Do I need to sign up for IAM?<a name="DoINeedToSignUp"></a>

If you don't already have an AWS account, you need to create one to use IAM\. You don't need to specifically sign up to use IAM\. There is no charge to use IAM\. 

**Note**  
IAM works only with AWS products that are integrated with IAM\. For a list of services that support IAM, see [AWS services that work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md)\. 

**To sign up for AWS**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

# IAM JSON Policy Elements: NotResource<a name="reference_policies_elements_notresource"></a>

`NotResource` is an advanced policy element that explicitly matches everything except the specified list of resources\. Using `NotResource` can result in a shorter policy by listing only a few resources that should not match, rather than including a long list of resources that will match\. When using `NotResource`, you should keep in mind that resources specified in this element are the *only* resources that are limited\. This, in turn, means that all of the resources, including the resources in all other services, that are not listed are allowed if you use the `Allow` effect, or are denied if you use the `Deny` effect\. Statements must include either a `Resource` or a `NotResource` element that specifies a resource using an ARN\. \(For more information about the format of ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\) and AWS Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)\.\) 

Be careful using the `NotResource` element and `"Effect": "Allow"` in the same statement or in a different statement within a policy\. `NotResource` allows all services and resources that are not explicitly listed, and could result in granting users more permissions than you intended\. Using the `NotResource` element and `"Effect": "Deny"` in the same statement denies services and resources that are not explicitly listed\.

For example, imagine you have a group named `HRPayroll`\. Members of `HRPayroll` should not be allowed to access any Amazon S3 resources except the `Payroll` folder in the `HRBucket` bucket\. The following policy explicitly denies access to all Amazon S3 resources (and all other Amazon services like EC2, SQS, etc) other than the listed resources\. Note, however, that this policy does not grant the user access to any resources\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "NotResource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::HRBucket/Payroll",
      "arn:aws:s3:::HRBucket/Payroll/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Normally, to explicitly deny access to a resource you would write a policy that uses `"Effect":"Deny"` and that includes a `Resource` element that lists each folder individually\. However, in that case, each time you add a folder to `HRBucket`, or add a resource to Amazon S3 that should not be accessed, you must add its name to the list in `Resource`\. If you use a `NotResource` element instead, users are automatically denied access to new folders unless you add the folder names to the `NotResource` element\.

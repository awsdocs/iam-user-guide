# Managing Passwords for IAM Users<a name="id_credentials_passwords_admin-change-user"></a>

IAM users who use the AWS Management Console to work with AWS resources must have a password in order to sign in\. You can create, change, or delete a password for an IAM user in your AWS account\. 

After you have assigned a password to a user, the user can sign in to the AWS Management Console using the sign\-in URL for your account, which looks like this: 

```
https://12-digit-AWS-account-ID or alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

For more information about how IAM users sign in to the AWS Management Console, see [The IAM Console and Sign\-in Page](console.md)\. 

In addition to manually creating individual passwords for your IAM users, you can create a password policy that applies to all IAM user passwords in your AWS account\.

You can use a password policy to do these things:
+ Set a minimum password length\.
+ Require specific character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non\-alphanumeric characters\. Be sure to remind your users that passwords are case sensitive\.
+ Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords\.
**Note**  
When you allow your IAM users to change their own passwords, IAM automatically allows them to view the password policy\. IAM users need permission to view the account's password policy in order to create a password that complies with the policy\.
+ Require IAM users to change their password after a specified period of time \(enable password expiration\)\.
+ Prevent IAM users from reusing previous passwords\.
+ Force IAM users to contact an account administrator when the user has allowed his or her password to expire\.

For information about managing your account's password policy, see [Setting an Account Password Policy for IAM Users](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md)\.

Even if your users have their own passwords, they still need permissions to access your AWS resources\. By default, a user has no permissions\. To give your users the permissions they need, you assign policies to them or to the groups they belong to\. For information about creating users and groups, see [Identities \(Users, Groups, and Roles\)](id.md)\. For information about using policies to set permissions, see [Changing Permissions for an IAM User](id_users_change-permissions.md)\. 

You can grant users permission to change their own passwords\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM Users to Change Their Own Passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\. For information about how users access your account sign\-in page, see [The IAM Console and Sign\-in Page](console.md)\.

## Creating, Changing, or Deleting an IAM User Password \(Console\)<a name="id_credentials_passwords_admin-change-user_console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to manage passwords for your IAM users\.

When users leave your organization or no longer need AWS access, it is important to find the credentials that they were using and ensure that they are no longer operational\. Ideally, you delete credentials if they are no longer needed\. You can always recreate them at a later date if the need arises\. At the very least you should change the credentials so that the former users no longer have access\.

**To add a password for an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to create\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Sign\-in credentials**, choose **Manage password** next to **Console password**\.

1. In **Manage console access**, for **Console access** choose **Enable** if not already selected\. If console access is disabled, then no password is needed\.

1. For **Set password**, choose whether to have IAM generate a password or create a custom password: 
   + To have IAM generate a password, choose **Autogenerated password**\.
   + To create a custom password, choose **Custom password**, and type the password\. 
**Note**  
The password that you create must meet the account's [password policy](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md), if one is currently set\.

1. To require the user to create a new password when signing in, choose **Require password reset**\. Then choose **Apply**\.
**Important**  
If you select the **Require password reset** option, make sure that the user has permission to change his or her password\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM Users to Change Their Own Passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\.

1. If you choose the option to autogenerate a password, choose **Show** in the **New password** dialog box\. This lets you view the password so you can share it with the user\. 
**Important**  
For security reasons, you cannot access the password after completing this step, but you can create a new password at any time\.

**To change the password for an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to change\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Sign\-in credentials**, choose **Manage password** next to **Console password**\.

1. In **Manage console access**, for **Console access** choose **Enable** if not already selected\. If console access is disabled, then no password is needed\.

1. For **Set password**, choose whether to have IAM generate a password or create a custom password: 
   + To have IAM generate a password, choose **Autogenerated password**\.
   + To create a custom password, choose **Custom password**, and type the password\. 
**Note**  
The password that you create must meet the account's [password policy](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md), if one is currently set\.

1. To require the user to create a new password when signing in, choose **Require password reset**\. Then choose **Apply**\.
**Important**  
If you select the **Require password reset** option, make sure that the user has permission to change his or her password\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM Users to Change Their Own Passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\.

1. If you choose the option to autogenerate a password, choose **Show** in the **New password** dialog box\. This lets you view the password so you can share it with the user\. 
**Important**  
For security reasons, you cannot access the password after completing this step, but you can create a new password at any time\.

**To delete an IAM user's password**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to delete\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Sign\-in credentials**, choose **Manage password** next to **Console password**\.

1. For **Console access**, choose **Disable**, and then choose **Apply**\.

**Important**  
When you remove a user's password, the user can no longer sign in to the AWS Management Console\. If the user has active access keys, they continue to function and allow access through the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API function calls\.

# Creating IAM Roles<a name="id_roles_create"></a>

To create a role, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, the Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the IAM API\.

If you use the AWS Management Console, a wizard guides you through the steps for creating a role\. The wizard has slightly different steps depending on whether you're creating a role for an AWS service, for an AWS account, or for a federated user\.

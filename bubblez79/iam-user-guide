# AWS: Allows enabling and disabling AWS Regions<a name="reference_policies_examples_aws-enable-disable-regions"></a>

This example shows how you might create an identity\-based policy that allows an administrator to enable and disable the Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\) Region \(ap\-east\-1\)\. This policy defines permissions for programmatic and console access\. This setting appears in the **Account settings** page in the AWS Management Console\. This page includes sensitive account\-level information that should be viewed and managed only by account administrators\. To use this policy, replace the *italicized placeholder text* in the example policy with your own information\. Then, follow the directions in [create a policy](access_policies_create.md) or [edit a policy](access_policies_manage-edit.md)\.

**Important**  
You cannot enable or disable regions that are enabled by default\. You can only include regions that are *disabled* by default\. For more information, see [Managing AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
